ZenFire C++ Examples
====================

These example programs put the Zen-Fire API through its paces, and illustrate
some common patterns for how to best use the API.

For instructions on building them on specific platforms, see the files titled
README.platform.txt.

Tag Notes
====================

The respository will have a git tag for the version of the API that the examples are targeted at.  It's best to use the tagged versions of the examples, especially if you experience problems using either master HEAD or a different tag from the API version you're using.  Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, use the tagged examples, as the master branch may contain changes for as-yet unreleased versions of the API.

To check the specific tag on Linux or Windows, use these commands (fill in the appropriate version..)

    git clone git://github.com/ZenFire/cpp_examples.git
    cd cpp_examples
    git checkout 1.9.42.19
