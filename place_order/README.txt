Place Order
----------------------
This example shows how to place orders using the ZenFire API.  It's somewhat simple, merely allowing a user to place one of four types of order with the relevant parameters, and not showing overly much information about the progress of the order.  The account_watcher example shows the paces of receiving order events.
